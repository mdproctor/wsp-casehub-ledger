**Workspace type:** public

## Session Start


## Artifact Locations

| Skill | Writes to |
|-------|-----------|
| brainstorming (specs) | `specs/` (workspace staging) |
| writing-plans (plans) | `plans/` |
| handover | `HANDOFF.md` |
| idea-log | `IDEAS.md` |
| design-snapshot | `snapshots/` |
| java-update-design / update-primary-doc | `design/JOURNAL.md` (created by `epic`) |
| adr | `adr/` (workspace staging) |
| write-blog | `blog/` |

## Structure

- `HANDOFF.md` — session handover (single file, overwritten each session)
- `IDEAS.md` — idea log (single file)
- `specs/` — brainstorming / design specs (staging; promoted to project `docs/specs/` at epic close)
- `plans/` — implementation plans (ephemeral; stay in workspace only)
- `snapshots/` — design snapshots with INDEX.md (auto-pruned, max 10)
- `adr/` — architecture decision records (staging; promoted to project `docs/adr/` at epic close)
- `blog/` — project diary entries with INDEX.md
- `design/` — epic journal (created by `epic` at branch start)

## Git Discipline

Two git repositories are active in every session: a **workspace** (staging area for specs and ADRs; permanent home for blog, handover, plans, snapshots) and the **project repo** (source code + promoted specs and ADRs).

Before any git operation, run `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` to confirm which repo is currently active. Do not assume — the session may have opened in either. cd to the correct repo before staging:
- Source code commits → project repo
- Specs and ADRs → workspace first, then promote to project repo at epic close

## Rules

- **Specs and ADRs are project knowledge** — final home is the project repo under `docs/specs/` and `docs/adr/`
- The workspace `specs/` and `adr/` directories are staging areas only — skills write there first
- **Promotion at epic close**: copy spec/ADR files to project repo, commit there; leave workspace copies in place
- Plans (`plans/`) are ephemeral — workspace only, never promoted
- Blog, handover, snapshots, design journal — workspace only, never promoted

## Routing

| Artifact   | Destination | Notes |
|------------|-------------|-------|
| adr        | project     | lands in `docs/adr/` — promoted at epic close |
| specs      | project     | lands in `docs/specs/` — promoted at epic close |
| blog       | project     | lands in `docs/blog/` — promoted at work end |
| plans      | workspace   | stay in workspace permanently |
| design     | project     | journal file lives in workspace design/; ARC42STORIES.MD is the primary architecture record at project root |
| snapshots  | workspace   | stay in workspace permanently |
| handover   | workspace   | |
